## _**Introduction:**_

An effective trading strategy is essential in attempting to sustain a living as a retail trader. It is without a doubt challenging, but exciting at the same time. The most consistent way, to avoid becoming an all too familiar statistical loser in the stock market, includes a necessary combination of advanced strategy, risk management, discipline, money management, emotional intelligence and now the proper computational tools utilizing machine intelligence. In the end, the trader's success depends on the proven, straight-forward strategy that is flexible enough to be effective for any security that meets our criteria.

No matter which strategy is chosen, the success or failure truly depends on three main components that can't be ignored:

* **Volume:** The volume informs us as to how much the instrument has been traded in the focal period. Elevated volume speaks to the significant change in interest for the asset or security. Usually (EDA focus), an increase in this metric will educate the informed trader that an impending price jump is approaching, price movement up or down doesn't matter, we can capitalize.

* **Volatility:** You can forecast the potential profit range based on historical volatility. Assuming that that price movement will recur in a manner consistent with past events - following support and resistance points, and trend lines can help predict the action.  However, elevated volatility will not only impact your profit potential, the traders risk potential is greater at the same time.  Whiplash or reversals can eat away profits very fast in a volatile market.

and last, but certainly not least:

* **Liquidity:** Liquidity enables the quick movement in and out of a position.  A trader's edge often depends on small price deltas, a lot of that can be lost if a large spread exists between the bid and ask.  This happens from a lack of liquidity (The Law of Supply and Demand). Profits erode quickly if an asset or security is illiquid, preventing the trader from executing at the target price.  Settling for the much lower bid, or much higher ask!

Before we submerge ourselves in the complexity that is the world of highly technical indicators, our exploratory analysis should focus on the basics. Often people think the basics aren't enough to improve upon the win-ratio. I am developing this introduction to argue that we will accomplish just that with the incorporation and analysis of principal elements. We will let exploratory data analysis and automated processes do the heavy lifting in the technicals, allowing more time to focus on discipline and emotional intelligence for the win.

## _**The Pipeline:**_

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Selecting the security from over-night action (Gaps)
  * Looking for securities that have gained attention from other traders/algorithms with acceptable ~3% (+ or -) gap
  * Preferred market float and relative volume to ensure volatitility and liquidity 
2. Perform web scraping on the news associated with the selected financial instrument
  * "news" source: recent blogs, chats, social media, surveys, articles, and documents
  * Perform VADER sentitment analysis to forecast directional movement out of the gate (opening bell)
      * VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): a lexicon and rule-based analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed
